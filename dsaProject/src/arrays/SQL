WHERE j.new_salary > j.old_salary;


 difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN:
 INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. 
 OUTER JOIN returns all rows from one table and the matched rows from the other. There are three types of outer joins: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN

 Explain the GROUP BY clause and its use:
 The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
 It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN to produce summary reports

 What is a primary key:
 A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values. Each table can have only one primary key

 What are foreign keys and their purpose:
 A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. 
 The purpose of a foreign key is to ensure referential integrity between tables.

 How would you use the LIMIT clause:
 The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query. For example, SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5 returns only the first 5 rows from the table.

 What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE clauses?
The WHERE clause filters rows before grouping (used with SELECT and JOIN statements), while the HAVING clause filters groups after aggregation (used with GROUP BY).

Explain the use of the DISTINCT keyword:
The DISTINCT keyword removes duplicate rows from the result set. For example, SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name returns only unique values of column_name

What are subqueries and how are they used:
Subqueries are queries nested within another SQL query. They are used to perform operations in a hierarchical or dependent manner,
such as filtering results based on a condition calculated by another query.

Describe what a JOIN operation does:
 A JOIN operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN

How do you use the CASE statement in SQL?
SELECT name,
       CASE 
           WHEN score >= 90 THEN 'A'
           WHEN score >= 80 THEN 'B'
           ELSE 'F'
       END AS grade
FROM students;


Advanced SQL:
What are indexes and how do they improve query performance?
indexes are database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and slower writes. 
They work by creating a data structure (like a B-tree) that allows fast lookups.

Explain UNION vs. UNION ALL:
UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicates. UNION ALL combines the result sets but does not remove duplicates,
making it faster.

What is normalization and why is it important:
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. 
It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables.

Describe a self join and its use case:
Triggers are automatic actions executed in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. 
They are used for tasks like auditing changes, enforcing business rules, and maintaining referential integrity.

How can you optimize a slow SQL query?
Optimizing a slow query can involve creating appropriate indexes, using EXPLAIN to analyze query performance, avoiding SELECT *, 
breaking complex queries into simpler subqueries, and making sure the database schema is normalized.

What are common table expressions (CTEs) and how are they used:
 CTEs are temporary result sets defined within the execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 
 They are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into more readable parts.

 Explain the difference between ROWNUM and ROW_NUMBER():
 ROWNUM is a pseudo-column in Oracle that assigns a unique number to each row in the result set, starting from 1. 
 ROW_NUMBER() is a window function in SQL that assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of a result set.

 What is a view and how does it differ from a table:
 A view is a virtual table that is based on the result set of an SQL query. Unlike tables, views do not store data; 
 they dynamically generate results from the base tables.

 Describe how to use window functions:
 Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. They include functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), 
 and NTILE(). For example
 SELECT name, score,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY class ORDER BY score DESC) as rank
FROM students;

SQL Integration with Java:
How do you connect to a database in Java?
Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API to connect to a database. This involves loading the JDBC driver, establishing a connection using DriverManager, 
and executing SQL queries using Statement or PreparedStatement.


Explain the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement in JDBC:
Statement is used for executing static SQL queries without parameters. PreparedStatement is used for executing precompiled SQL queries with parameters, 
providing better performance and security against SQL injection.

What is a connection pool and why is it important:
A connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained to avoid the overhead of opening and closing connections frequently. 
It improves application performance and resource management.

How can you handle transactions in JDBC:
Use the Connection object's transaction management methods: setAutoCommit(false) to start a transaction, commit() to commit, and rollback() 
to revert changes in case of errors

Describe how to use ORM frameworks like Hibernate with SQL databases:
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like Hibernate map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. They abstract the database interactions,
allowing developers to work with Java objects instead of writing SQL queries.

What is the use of ResultSet in JDBC?
ResultSet is used to retrieve and navigate through the data returned by executing SQL queries. It provides methods for iterating over the result set and 
accessing column values

How do you handle database exceptions in Java:
Use try-catch blocks to handle SQL exceptions (SQLException). Log the error details and use specific exception handling for known issues 
(e.g., connection failures, constraint violations)

Explain how to execute stored procedures in JDBC:
 Use CallableStatement to execute stored procedures in JDBC. You can set input parameters and retrieve output parameters using registerOutParameter

 What is SQL injection and how can you prevent it:
 SQL injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code. Prevent it by using PreparedStatement or CallableStatement instead 
 of string concatenation to build SQL queries.

 Describe how to batch insert/update in JDBC;
 Use addBatch() and executeBatch() methods in PreparedStatement to perform batch insert/update operations, reducing the number of database 
 round trips and improving performance.

 SQL Performance and Optimization:
 What is a query plan and how do you analyze it:
 A query plan (or execution plan) is a detailed step-by-step analysis generated by the database engine to execute a query. 
 Use the EXPLAIN statement to review the plan and optimize the query based on its performance

 How does indexing affect query performance?
Indexing improves query performance by allowing faster retrieval of rows. However, it can slow down insert, update, and delete operations 
due to the overhead of maintaining the index.

Explain what denormalization is and why it might be used:
Denormalization involves combining tables or introducing redundancy to optimize read performance. It’s used when read operations are more frequent
than writes and performance is critical.

What is a covering index:
A covering index is an index that contains all the columns required by a query, thus preventing the need to access the actual table. 
This can significantly speed up query performance.

How would you handle large datasets in SQL:
Handle large datasets by using pagination (LIMIT and OFFSET), indexing, partitioning tables, using appropriate data types, and optimizing queries 
to retrieve only the necessary data.
