Microservices and REST:
What is a microservice and how does it differ from a monolithic architecture:
A microservice is a small, independently deployable service that focuses on a single business function. Unlike monolithic architecture, microservices allow
for decentralized data management,independent scaling, and deployment


Explain how RESTful web services work:
RESTful web services use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations. They represent resources as URIs and use stateless communication for
interoperability between clients and servers

What is Feign in the context of Spring Cloud:
Feign is a declarative web service client that simplifies HTTP API client creation by reducing boilerplate code and integrating seamlessly with Spring Cloud for 
load balancing and fault tolerance.

Describe the purpose of Hystrix and how it works:
Hystrix is a library for latency and fault tolerance in distributed systems. It isolates points of access to external systems, provides fallback mechanisms, 
and prevents cascading failures.

How does Spring Boot handle configuration management:
 Spring Boot handles configuration through application properties or YAML files, allowing externalized configuration and supporting profiles for 
environment-specific settings.

What are microservices? How do they differ from monolithic architectures?
Microservices: Architectural style where an application is composed of small, independently deployable services that work together.
Monolithic: Single-tiered software application where all components are interconnected and interdependent.

What are the key benefits of using microservices architecture?
Scalability, agility, resilience, technology diversity, and easier deployment and maintenance are among the advantages.

Explain service discovery in microservices architecture.
Service discovery is the mechanism by which microservices locate and communicate with each other without hard-coding service locations.
Examples include tools like Netflix Eureka, Consul, and Kubernetes' service discovery features.

How do microservices communicate with each other?
Typically via lightweight protocols like HTTP/HTTPS using REST or messaging protocols like AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) or Kafka.

What is the role of API Gateways in microservices architecture?
API Gateways act as a single entry point for clients to access various microservices. They handle routing, authentication, rate limiting, and protocol translation.

Explain the challenges associated with microservices architecture.
Distributed systems complexity, data consistency, network latency, monitoring, and managing inter-service communication are common challenges.

How do you handle distributed transactions in microservices?
Strategies include Saga pattern, two-phase commit (2PC), compensating transactions, and leveraging eventual consistency.

What is circuit breaker pattern? Why is it used in microservices?
Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures in a distributed system. It monitors for failures and short-circuits calls to services that are likely to fail.

What tools or frameworks have you used for building and managing microservices?
Examples include Spring Boot, Netflix OSS (Eureka, Ribbon, Hystrix), Kubernetes, Docker, and Apache Kafka.

REST Interview Questions:
Explain RESTful architecture. What are its principles?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Principles include stateless communication, uniform interface (HTTP verbs), and resource-based interactions.

What are HTTP methods commonly used in RESTful APIs?
GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete), PATCH (partial update), OPTIONS (metadata), HEAD (header).

What is HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) in REST?
HATEOAS is a constraint in REST where the response from a server includes links to related resources, enabling navigation of the application state.

Explain the difference between PUT and POST HTTP methods.
PUT: Used to update a resource or create it if it doesn't exist, typically idempotent.
POST: Used to create a new resource or perform custom actions that aren't covered by the standard CRUD operations.

What is content negotiation in RESTful APIs? How is it achieved?
Content negotiation allows clients and servers to agree on the format of the data being transferred (e.g., JSON, XML). 
Achieved using Accept and Content-Type headers in HTTP requests and responses.

What are RESTful best practices for designing URIs?
Use nouns (resources) instead of verbs, use plural nouns for consistency, avoid deep nesting, use query parameters for filtering/sorting.

How do you handle authentication and authorization in RESTful APIs?
Methods include OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), basic authentication, API keys, and role-based access control (RBAC).

What tools or frameworks have you used to develop RESTful APIs in Java?
Examples include Spring MVC, JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services), Jersey, and Dropwizard.

 Versioning REST APIs:
Use URL, request parameter, or header for versioning.
URL Versioning:@GetMapping("/api/v1/products/{id}")
Parameter Versioning:@GetMapping(value = "/api/products/{id}", params = "version=1")
Header Versioning:@GetMapping(value = "/api/products/{id}", headers = "X-API-VERSION=1")

 Implementing Security with JWT:
Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
Add Dependencies:jjwt
Generate JWT Token:Jwts.builder(),ignatureAlgorithm.HS256
Validate JWT Token:Jwts.parser()
Filter for JWT:JwtAuthenticationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter (doFilterInternal method)(bearer)
Security Configuration:SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter(configure method) csrf().disable()

Question: Explain what a REST API is and describe its key characteristics.
Answer: A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services.
Key characteristics include statelessness, a uniform interface, resource-based interactions, and the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
 
Question: Map the CRUD operations to the appropriate HTTP methods in a REST API.
Answer:
Create: POST
Read: GET
Update: PUT or PATCH
Delete: DELETE
 

Question: What are some best practices for naming resources in REST APIs?
Answer:
Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., /users, /orders).
Use plural names for collections (e.g., /users for the collection of user resources).
Use hierarchical URLs to represent relationships (e.g., /users/{userId}/orders).

Question: What HTTP status codes would you use for the following scenarios?
Successful resource creation
Resource not found
Invalid request data
Server error
Answer:
Successful resource creation: 201 Created
Resource not found: 404 Not Found
Invalid request data: 400 Bad Request
Server error: 500 Internal Server Error

Question: When should you use query parameters versus path variables in REST APIs?
Answer:
Path Variables: Use for identifying specific resources (e.g., /users/{userId}).
Query Parameters: Use for filtering, sorting, or pagination (e.g., /users?age=30&sort=name).

Question: What does it mean for an HTTP method to be idempotent? Which HTTP methods are idempotent?
Answer: An HTTP method is idempotent if multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. Idempotent methods include GET, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD.

Question: How can you handle versioning in a REST API?
Answer:
URI Versioning: Include the version number in the URI (e.g., /v1/users).
Query Parameters: Use a query parameter to specify the version (e.g., /users?version=1).
Custom Headers: Include the version in a custom header (e.g., X-API-Version: 1).

Question: How do you handle content negotiation in a REST API?
Answer: Content negotiation is handled using the Accept header in the request to specify the desired response format (e.g., application/json, application/xml). The server responds with the content type specified in the Content-Type header.

Question: Describe how you would implement authentication and authorization in a REST API.
Answer:
Authentication: Use methods like Basic Auth, Token-based Auth (e.g., JWT), or OAuth.
Authorization: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or access control lists (ACLs) to control what authenticated users can do.

Question: How should you handle errors in a REST API?
Answer:
Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
Provide a clear and consistent error response format, typically including an error code, message, and possibly details.
